This error occurs when you are trying to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations where data hasn't yet loaded.  For example, if you're trying to render data from an API call before the call has completed, you might encounter this error.  Another common scenario is accessing a nested property where an intermediate object is null or undefined. 

```javascript
// Example:  Accessing a property before data is loaded
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/user')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setUser(data));
}, []);

// Incorrect:  This will throw an error if user is still null
return (
  <Text>Username: {user.name}</Text> //Error
);
```
